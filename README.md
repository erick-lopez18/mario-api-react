# Mario API 
A basic REST API for managing Mario Bros franchise data. The API returns data related to Mario characters, games, and their console platforms.

The purpose of this project is to gain familiarity with the [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) framework for Node.js. NestJS is a TypeScript-based framework built ontop of Express. It is inspired by the architecture of Angular and provides a more opinionated architecture that supports the MVC pattern and domain-driven development.
